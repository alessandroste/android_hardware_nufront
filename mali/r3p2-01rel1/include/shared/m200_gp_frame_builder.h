 *         MALI_OUTPUT_DEPTH 
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_STENCIL

 *            Color can not be set if depth or stencil is set. At least one of these must be set. 
 *
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_MRT
 *            The WBX will output in MRT mode. This will output all 4 subsamples to the memory 
 *            buffer given by the surface instead of the regular output. The surface->mem_ref given 
 *            in the surface need to contain a memory block that is (at least) 4x as large as the 
 *            surface->datatype, plus any offset. The offset to the individual subsample outputs is 
 *            given as the surface->offset plus respectively: 
 *             - 0
 *             - 1*surface->datasize
 *             - 2*surface->datasize 
 *             - 3*surface->datasize. 
 *            Each of these offsets need to be aligned to the surface alignment requirements. 
 *            This flag is typically only used by the incremental rendering subsystem, and can be 
 *            ignored for average users of the framebuilder. 
 *

 *         MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_X_4X
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_X_8X
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_Y_2X
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_Y_4X
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_Y_8X
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_Y_16X      -- note: there is no matching dowscale for the X axis
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_FSAA_4X   => same as MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_X_2X | MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_Y_2X 
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_FSAA_16X  => same as MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_X_4X | MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_Y_4X
 *            Specifies supersampling downscale. 
 *            The WBx unit will downsample the outputs in both X and Y dimensions at the requested factor,
 *            or in one of the directions at the specified factor, before outputting the results. The flags
 *            setting both factors effectively set both axis flags at one. Only one of these bits per
 *            axis can be specified. The output surfaces specified with either of these flags should 
 *            be sized accordingly smaller. F.ex, if you are rendering to a 20x20 surface with 
 *            MALI_OUTPUT_DOWNSAMPLE_4X set, then the framebuilder internally will set up an output 
 *            of 80x80 pixels (pre-downscale), and querying the framebuilder for size will return 80x80. 
 *            Other surfaces without downsample set should be sized 80x80 as well. This flag is not 
 *            mutually exclusive with the MRT flag. Typically, 16x FSAA is created by setting
 *            MALI_OUTPUT_FSAA_4X as well as enabling 4x multisampling.
 *
 *         MALI_OUTPUT_WRITE_DIRTY_PIXELS_ONLY
 *            Sets the WBx_DIRTY_BIT_ENABLE HW flag. This flag ensures that only pixels written to 
 *            in the tile buffer are written back to the framebuffer. This prevents background pixels
 *            from being written, but breaks badly for blended geometry and antialiasing. Use conciously. 
 *
 * @note If the surface set to the framebuilder don't match up in size (modified for downscale), an assert is 
 *       raised on the next drawcall. Do not change the output resolution between the first drawcall and swap.
